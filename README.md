Historical Friction
==

History is all around us. The voices of the past thicken the air, calling out for your attention. When it all gets too much, pull the ear-buds out, stop, and look at where you are with fresh eyes, in the new silence...

This is a very straightforward toy, built on an early version of Ed Summer's 'ici' (https://github.com/edsu/ici). I didn't fork it, as I wasn't very sure of what I was doing with git. We're all learning, right?

Summer's original readme file continues below. Stuart Eve and I used a javascript library called speak-js to do the text to speech. (http://https://github.com/mattytemple/speak-js). The original idea for 'historical friction' is at (http://electricarchaeology.ca/2013/04/24/historical-friction/) and you can hear a version at (http://graeworks.net/historicalfriction/)

ici
===

ici (French for here) is an HTML/JavaScript app for displaying Wikipedia 
articles that are relevant for your current location. Articles with a pink
background need an image, which you should now be able to easily upload
from your mobile device, since Wikipedia has streamlined the process.

If you are on the go the list should refresh every minute, adding newly
discovered articles to the top of the list. Especially fun while you are
on a bus/train :-D
